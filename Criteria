1. Frontend:
• Layout: Using semantic HTML and CSS to build the user interface.
• Interactivity: Using JavaScript to create dynamic UI elements, event handling, and user
interaction.
• Adaptability: Competent adaptation of the interface to different devices and screen sizes.
Comment:
It is not necessary to create a full-fledged web page. Since the course is aimed at studying
the backend part, you don’t have to focus on the frontend. Create a basic web page to interact with
the back part. You can even use a template from the Internet.
2. Backend:
• Request processing: Correct processing of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
on the server side.
• Asynchronous processing: Using asynchronous methods such as Promises or async/await
to process requests efficiently.
• RESTful API Implementation: Create an efficient and well-designed RESTful API,
including endpoints, request processing, and returning data in a usable format.
Comment:
Ensure that your server can correctly handle different types of HTTP requests, such as
GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Verify that request processing is performed efficiently and in
accordance with the requirements of your application.
Use asynchronous methods such as Promises or async/await to ensure efficient request
processing. This will help avoid blocking and improve your backend performance.
3. Database:
• Using the MongoDB driver to interact with the database.
• Implementation of basic operations (CRUD) for working with data in MongoDB.
Comment:
Verify that connecting to MongoDB is successful. Use the official MongoDB driver for
Node.js, for example 'mongodb'. Make sure your backend can successfully interact with the
database and perform basic CRUD operations.
4. Security:
• Injection protection: Taking measures to prevent injections and ensure the safety of queries
to MongoDB.
• Authentication and Authorization: Configure user accounts and their rights in MongoDB
to ensure secure access.
Comment:
MongoDB is protected against SQL injections, but it is important to check for and prevent
other types of injections, such as NoSQL injections.
Be sure to check and filter input data to prevent possible attacks.
Properly configure MongoDB authentication using unique accounts for the application.
Limit database access rights to the minimum required privileges.
5. Error Handling:
• Error handling on front-end and back-end: Correct error tracking and handling to prevent
application failures.
• Error handling when interacting with MongoDB: Provision of error handling mechanisms
when performing operations with the MongoDB database.
Comment:
Implement error handling mechanisms on the backend. This includes logging errors,
preventing information leaks, and returning readable and understandable error messages to the
client to facilitate diagnostics.
Develop a strategy for handling errors when interacting with MongoDB. This includes
checking for a database connection, handling query errors, and ensuring readable error messages
are returned to the client.
6. Testing:
• Unit Testing: Writing unit tests for the functions and components of your application.
• Unit testing MongoDB queries: Writing tests to verify the correctness of queries to
MongoDB.
• Integration testing: Testing the interaction of different parts of the application. Testing how
your application interacts with MongoDB.
Comment:
Don't forget to test your backend. Write unit tests for your features and integration tests to
check how different components interact.
This will help identify potential problems early in development.
Write unit tests for your MongoDB queries to ensure they are correct and as expected.
Run integration tests to test how your application interacts with MongoDB. Ensure that
CRUD operations work consistently and without errors.
7. Deployment:
• -Deployment: Successfully deployed the application to the server.
• -Server Configuration: Configure the server based on security and application
performance.
Comment:
In preparation for implementation, ensure that the server is properly configured, has
sufficient resources, and is secure.
Regularly update dependencies and monitor application performance during the
implementation process.
